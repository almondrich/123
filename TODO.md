# Dashboard Mobile Responsiveness Fix

## Tasks
- [ ] Update statistics cards CSS for better mobile display (reduce padding and font sizes)
- [ ] Modify table to hide less critical columns on mobile screens
- [ ] Adjust action buttons for mobile navigation
- [ ] Test the changes using browser tools or mobile view

## Notes
- Statistics cards currently use col-md-3, which stacks on mobile but cards are too large
- Recent Forms table has 8 columns making it hard to navigate on small screens
- Use Bootstrap responsive utilities to hide columns like Vehicle, Hospital, Age/Gender on mobile
